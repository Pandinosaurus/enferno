- **Authentication**: Flask-Security with role-based access control
- **OAuth Integration**: Google and GitHub login via Flask-Dance
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy ORM with PostgreSQL/SQLite support
- **Task Queue**: Celery with Redis for background tasks
- **Frontend**: Client-side Vue.js with Vuetify components
- **Docker Ready**: Production-grade Docker configuration
- **Cursor Rules**: Smart IDE-based code generation and assistance
- **Package Management**: Fast installation with uv

## Documentation Sections

- [Getting Started](/getting-started) - Installation and setup guide
- [Authentication](/authentication) - User management and OAuth setup
- [Development](/development) - Development guidelines and best practices
- [Deployment](/deployment) - Production deployment guide

## OAuth Integration

Supports social login with:
- Google (profile and email scope)
- GitHub (user:email scope)

Configure in `.env`:
```bash
# Google OAuth
GOOGLE_AUTH_ENABLED=true
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret

# GitHub OAuth
GITHUB_AUTH_ENABLED=true
GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
```

## Cursor Rules

Enferno now leverages Cursor Rules for intelligent code assistance and generation. This approach provides:

- Context-aware code generation through modern AI-powered IDEs
- Codebase-specific guidance tailored to Enferno's patterns
- Improved documentation integrated with development tools
- Framework-specific best practices and conventions
- More flexible workflow than template-based generation

Rules are organized by domain areas like Vue-Jinja integration and UI components to provide targeted assistance exactly when needed.
