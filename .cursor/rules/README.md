## How to Use These Rules

1. The rules are organized into separate markdown files by category
2. Start with the [index.md](index.md) file for an overview
3. Reference specific rule files as needed during development
4. Cursor AI will use these rules to provide more accurate and consistent assistance

## Rule Files

- [index.md](index.md) - Overview of all rules and technology stack
- [vue-jinja-patterns.md](vue-jinja-patterns.md) - Patterns for Vue.js and Jinja integration
- [ui-components.md](ui-components.md) - UI component patterns using Vuetify

## Framework Overview

Enferno is a full-stack web framework that combines:

- Python Flask backend

These rules help maintain consistency across the codebase and ensure that new features follow established patterns.
