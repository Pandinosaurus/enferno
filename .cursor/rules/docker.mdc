Docker Enhancement & Development

### 1. Code Quality
- Write clear, maintainable, and well-documented code.
- Use meaningful names for containers, images, and services.

### 2. Docker Best Practices
- Always use official base images when possible.
- Keep Dockerfiles as small and simple as possible.
- Use multi-stage builds to reduce image size.
- Avoid running containers as root unless necessary.

### 3. Version Control
- Commit often with clear, concise messages.
- Use feature branches for new enhancements.

### 4. Collaboration
- Review pull requests before merging.
- Report issues and bugs clearly with steps to reproduce.

### 5. Security
- Do not hardcode secrets or credentials in Dockerfiles or Compose files.
- Regularly update base images to the latest stable versions.

### 6. Testing
- Ensure all enhancements are covered by automated tests.
- Test images locally before pushing to a registry.

### 7. Documentation
- Update `README.md` and relevant docs for any changes.
- Document all new environment variables, ports, and volumes.
