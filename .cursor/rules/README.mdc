# Enferno Framework Rules for Cursor

This directory contains coding standards and patterns for the Enferno framework, organized according to the new Cursor rules convention.

## How to Use These Rules

1. The rules are organized into separate markdown files by category
2. Start with the [index.md](mdc:index.md) file for an overview
3. Reference specific rule files as needed during development
4. Cursor AI will use these rules to provide more accurate and consistent assistance

## Rule Files

- [index.md](mdc:index.md) - Overview of all rules and technology stack
- [vue-jinja-patterns.md](mdc:vue-jinja-patterns.md) - Patterns for Vue.js and Jinja integration
- [ui-components.md](mdc:ui-components.md) - UI component patterns using Vuetify
- [python-standards.md](mdc:python-standards.md) - Python coding standards for the backend

## Framework Overview

Enferno is a full-stack web framework that combines:

- Python Flask backend
- Vue.js frontend with Vuetify components
- Jinja2 templating
- Material Design UI
- RESTful API architecture

These rules help maintain consistency across the codebase and ensure that new features follow established patterns.
